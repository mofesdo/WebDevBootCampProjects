<h1>The Best Movies According to Modesto</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Surf's Up</h3>
<p>My favorite animal as a kid were penguins, I loved rock music, and I always wanted to learn to skateboard/surf! This movie is literally the embodiment of everything I loved as a kid and this is the movie I watched while in the hospital when I had broken my arm. It is my ultimate comfort movie.</p>
<h3>Shrek 2</h3>
<p>They say that seqeuls are always worse than the original but that isn't the case for Shrek 2. The character development of Shrek and his crew really shines through. The humor is so amazing for being able to be funny for children and adults at the same time! It still holds up to today's standards and the movie soundtrack is phenomenal.</p>
<h3>Mean Girls</h3>
<p>There are a lot of coming of age teen movies that are near and dear to people's hearts but Mean Girls takes the cake for me due to its hilarious comedy. It takes so many troupes from the genre and pokes fun at them. It doesn't take itself too serious but yet still manages to leave viewers with an important message of treating everyone with kindess.</p>
